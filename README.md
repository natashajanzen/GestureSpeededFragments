# GestureSpeededFragments

[**gsf.py**](gsf.py)  
A Python script to run the experiment, using [Psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/). This is the file to run in order to start the experiment.

[mainTrials.xlsx](mainTrials.xlsx)  
Spreadsheet of trial types.

[mainTrials_test.xlsx](mainTrials_test.xlsx)  
Abbreviated spreadsheet of trial types. For quick test runs.

[plots.py](plots.py)  
A script to make some quick plots of the results, using [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

[requirements.txt](requirements.txt)  
List of Python package versions used when developing the experiment. As produced by `pip freeze`. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies, for example in a new Python virtual environment.

[data](data)  
Data collected in the experiment is saved here. *.psydat* files store Psychopy TrialHandler objects. These are saved even if the subject does not complete the experiment. *.csv* files store results from completed runs of the experiment.

[extras](extras)  
Miscellaneous additional files.

[gestures](gestures)  
*.mp4* video files with the gestures. Shown on screen during the experiment.

[plots](plots)

# About the Author

I studied applied linguistics for my master's which introduced me to the inspiring world of open source software, evidence based research, and the beauty of collaboration for solving real world problems. My interests broadened from English language teaching to the development of tools and procedures for investigating when and how gesture based language learning takes place. Through this I discovered an empty niche in the gesture community toolbox: a tool for measuring gesture based language learning, which is robust enough to be used in applied research settings, but also precise enough for behavioral analysis, **and** that is also flexible in its functionality.
